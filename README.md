# Launch Chromium from Kodi
An incredibly bare-bones Kodi 19.x (Matrix) compatible Addon that launches Chromium.
Started as a fork from https://github.com/StudioAnadeji/script.launch.steam

## Usage

Download latest ZIP, install manually. Edit "addon.py" to set path and options. The Addon is currently set to use a Linux path by default, but this can be changed for us in any OS.
